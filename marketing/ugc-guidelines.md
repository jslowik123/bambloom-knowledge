# UGC Video Creation Guidelines

This document tells an AI agent everything it needs to create on-brand marketing videos for Bambloom.

## Golden Rules

1. **Never guilt, shame, or pressure.** Every video must feel supportive.
2. **Show, don't just tell.** Use app screenshots, garden visuals, panda mascot.
3. **Hook in first 1-2 seconds.** TikTok/Reels audiences decide instantly.
4. **End with clear CTA.** Always tell viewers what to do next.
5. **Use brand colors.** Warm Earth palette by default (cream, burgundy, sage).
6. **Keep it warm.** Soft transitions, gentle animations, rounded fonts.
7. **Progress over perfection.** This motto should permeate every video.

## Video Structure (Universal Template)

```
[0-2s]  HOOK — Stop the scroll. Bold text, relatable problem, or shocking stat.
[2-5s]  PAIN — Amplify the problem (75 Hard failures, guilt, perfectionism)
[5-8s]  PIVOT — Introduce the solution ("Then I found 75 Soft" / "Meet Bambloom")
[8-13s] SHOWCASE — Show app features (dashboard, garden, panda, journal)
[13-15s] CTA — "Download free" / "Link in bio" / "Start your journey"
```

## Content Pillars

### 1. Comparison (75 Hard vs 75 Soft)
- Best performer. Always leads with contrast.
- Show rules side by side (red vs green)
- Emphasize: no restart, rest days OK, cheat meals OK
- Emotional angle: "One breaks you, the other builds you"

### 2. Feature Demo
- Show one specific feature in action
- Dashboard task completion, garden growing, panda reacting
- Keep it focused — one feature per video
- "POV: Your habit tracker has a panda 🐼"

### 3. Transformation / Progress Journey
- Show Day 1 vs Day 30/50/75
- Empty garden → full garden timelapse
- Panda going from idle → celebrating
- Emotional music, milestone moments

### 4. Relatable Problems
- "POV: You failed 75 Hard again"
- "When your habit tracker makes you feel guilty"
- "Me trying to find a wellness app that doesn't yell at me"
- Always resolve with Bambloom as the answer

### 5. Aesthetic / Vibes
- Cozy setup shots with the app open
- "My morning routine with Bambloom"
- Calming music, warm lighting, lifestyle footage
- Garden beauty shots, theme showcase

## Visual Guidelines

### Backgrounds
- Warm cream/beige gradients (`#F5EDE8` → `#E8DDD5` → `#DCD0C6`)
- Never pure white or cold gray
- Dark brown gradients for dramatic hooks (`#44332F` → `#2D1F1A`)
- Green gradients for positive/solution scenes (`#7A9B6D` → `#5A7A50`)

### Text Styling
- **Hook text:** Large, bold, Quicksand or similar rounded font
- **Body text:** Clean, readable, Inter or similar
- **Emphasis:** Bold weight or color highlight (never underline)
- **ALL CAPS** only for hook/shock text, not elsewhere
- Text shadows on busy backgrounds
- Sufficient contrast always

### App Screenshots
- Use real app screenshots on iPhone frames
- Screenshots available in the main Bambloom project: `remotion/public/screenshots/`
- Show: dashboard.png, garden.png, journal.png, reflect.png, affirmations.png
- Always frame in a device mockup — never raw screenshots

### Panda Mascot Usage
- Use panda PNGs from `app/assets/mascot/`
- Available states: panda_happy, panda_wave, panda_idle, panda_blink, panda_celebrate
- Add gentle floating animation (subtle bob up/down)
- Panda should appear in CTA scenes and friendly moments
- Never make the panda look angry or disappointed

### Flower Assets
- 15 flower PNGs in `app/assets/Flowers/`
- Flower1-12: Regular garden flowers (colorful)
- Flower13-15: Golden Bloom (special, gold-tinted)
- Use for garden showcase scenes
- Add floating/growing animations

### Transitions
- Fade for emotional shifts
- Slide from bottom for reveals
- Slide from side for feature showcases
- Never harsh cuts (except for hook → pain point for dramatic effect)

## Audio Guidelines

- Use trending TikTok sounds when possible
- Soft, acoustic, or lo-fi background music for aesthetic videos
- Dramatic/emotional music for comparison and transformation content
- Consider voiceover for explainer-style content
- Text-on-screen works great for no-sound consumption

## Platform Specs

### TikTok / Instagram Reels / YouTube Shorts
- **Aspect Ratio:** 9:16 (vertical)
- **Resolution:** 1080 x 1920px
- **Duration:** 7-60 seconds (sweet spot: 12-20 seconds)
