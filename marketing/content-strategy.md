## Viral Content Formulas

### 1. Feature Demo
> Show ONE feature in action. Keep it tight. Make them want more.
> Example: "Your habits literally grow a garden 🌸" + garden screen recording

### 2. Comparison (75 Hard vs 75 Soft)
> Side-by-side rules. Red vs green. Always ends with Bambloom.
> Example: "75 Hard: Miss a day? Start over. 💀 / 75 Soft: Miss a day? Keep going. 💚"

### 3. Progress Journey
> Show transformation over time. Empty garden → full garden.
> Example: "Day 1 vs Day 50 in my 75 Soft Challenge"

### 4. Unique Feature
> Highlight something no other app has (panda, garden, affirmations).
> Example: "POV: Your habit tracker has a panda 🐼"

### 5. Problem/Solution
> Start with pain, end with relief.
> Example: "I failed 75 Hard 3 times. Then I found 75 Soft."

## Hooks That Work

| Pattern | Example | Why It Works |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Problem Awareness | "75 Hard is designed to make you fail" | Challenges accepted belief |
| Shocking Statement | "You don't need to suffer to build habits" | Contrarian, stops scroll |
| POV | "POV: You found the anti-75 Hard app" | Creates identity connection |
| Identity | "Girls who do 75 Soft >>" | Community belonging |
| Curiosity Gap | "Wait till you see the garden after 75 days" | Creates FOMO |
