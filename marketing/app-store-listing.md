## Full Description

Build lasting wellness habits with Bambloom — your gentle companion for the 75 Soft Challenge. Unlike extreme challenges that demand perfection, Bambloom celebrates progress, not punishment.

WHAT IS 75 SOFT?

75 Soft is a sustainable wellness challenge designed for real life. Complete four daily habits for 75 days:

• Drink 3L of water
• 45-minute workout (with one rest day per week allowed)
• Read 10 pages
• Eat well (cheat meals are okay!)

No restarts. No perfectionism. Just 75 days of consistent, gentle progress.

Every day you complete becomes a flower in your personal garden. Watch your meadow grow as you build healthy habits — a beautiful visual reminder of how far you've come.
